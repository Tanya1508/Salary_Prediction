# Salary_Prediction
This is a simple beginner project in which we have to predict the salary of an employee on the basis of Years of Experience. 
The ML models used in this project are Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression.
We can experiment with different ML models on the dataset to analyze which one performs the best.
The dataset is taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rsadiq/salary
